# Budget Manager

This is a simple application to keep track of monthly income and spending allowances. It can be used by
anyone with a need to manage their expenses. I created this because I love budgeting and organizing.

This application can:
- add any amount of spending categories
- calculate total savings (income - all costs)
- list spending categories as definite amounts *or* as ranges.
