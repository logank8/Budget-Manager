# Budget Manager

This is a simple application to keep track of monthly income and spending allowances. It can be used by
anyone with a need to manage their expenses. I created this because I love budgeting and organizing.

This application can:
- add any amount of spending categories
- calculate total savings (income - all costs)
  - when savings are calculated, the highest bound of each range is taken.
- list spending categories as definite amounts *or* as ranges.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add new categories to my budget and assign those values as an amount or range.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit the name and values of any category.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit the amount of income.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the amount of savings I will have with my current spending amounts.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove categories from my budget.
- As a user, I want to be able to save a budget to file
- As a user, I want to be able to choose to load a budget from file

### Phase 4: Task 3

For refactoring I wish I could have found a way to merge the categories subtypes and their panels.
I also should have anticipated complications with my subtypes a bit more, because then it would have made coding the rest a little easier.
